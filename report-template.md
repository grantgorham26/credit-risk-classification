# Module 12 Report 

## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of this challenge was to take some data about a person who is applying for a loan and train a machine learning model on this data to determine whether a person is likely to get a loan or not. 

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
The financial data included the size of the loan, the specific interest rate fo the loan, income of the borrower, a debt to income ratio, the number of accounts of the borrower, the number of deragatory marks on a borrowers account, the borrowers total debt, and whether the borrowe was approved for the loan. Using this data we are trying to determine whether someone is likley to be approved or not be approved for a loan. 

* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.

* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
